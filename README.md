# CALIBR — Posture Coach (companion app prototype)

A mobile-first, portrait companion app for the **CALIBR** indoor golf trainer.
CALIBR reproduces 5 balance profiles (Driver, Fairway Wood, Hybrid, Mid Iron,
Wedge) in a single club and trains swing & putting by joint-recognition sensors —
no ball, no mat.

The product philosophy is **zero-screen**: you don't look at a screen while you
practice. So this app is not a live dashboard. It's a coach you check at exactly
two moments — **before** practice (briefs today's mission) and **after** practice
(reviews your posture). Its identity is proving *"your body is improving,"* so it
captures a one-time **baseline** and shows growth by comparison against it.

## Run it

Pure HTML/CSS/JS — **no build step, no dependencies.**

- **Easiest:** double-click `standalone.html` (everything inlined into one file).
- **Source version:** open `index.html`. If your browser blocks the local
  `styles.css` / `app.js` over `file://`, serve the folder over HTTP, e.g. any
  static server pointed at this directory, then open `/index.html`.

### Deep-link query params (handy for demos)
- `?screen=home|report|growth|profile` — jump straight to a screen (skips onboarding)
- `?tab=calendar|metrics|ba` — pick the Growth sub-tab
- `?ob=0` — start on Home without onboarding

## What's inside

| Screen | Contents |
|---|---|
| **Launch** (first entry) | full-bleed photo background (`assets/launch.jpg`) + dark bottom-heavy scrim · CALIBR wordmark top · big uppercase slogan + one-line subcopy · **Log in** (dark glass) / **Get started** (white) pills. Get started → onboarding (new user); Log in → home (returning). Falls back to a golf-toned gradient if no photo is present. |
| **Onboarding** | concept ("no screen while you train") → pair club & stand → goal (target score + next round). **Phone-only** — no swing capture and no camera-framing step, so you never put the phone down and pick it back up. |
| **Baseline** | No separate capture step. Your **first real session is saved automatically as your baseline (Day 0)** — Home shows a "tonight becomes your Day 0" banner, the START overlay confirms it, and the first report opens in baseline mode (no vs-last deltas). Every later session and the growth/Before-After views compare against it. |
| **Missions** | **Round Prep** teal hero card (D-day + "start round prep" → a set built from your recent weak spots) as the star · category filter chips (All · Swing · Putting · Recommended) · mission cards with a concrete goal sentence, est. time, balance-mode badge (Driver·Fairway Wood·Hybrid·Mid Iron·Wedge·Putt), difficulty, and a completion check · tap a card to start that mission. Goals are measurable actions only (counts / tempo / pass-fail) — no field-round or score simulation. |
| **Home** (before) | greeting · **light D-day bar** (tap → Missions; round prep is started there, not here) · streak · this-week · condition check (3-level state + discomfort multi-select) · today's mission (teal hero card, auto-adjusts to condition/injury) · correction of the day · start |
| **Session Report** (after) | **Depends on the session type.** A **putting** session shows a *game-result report* — big mission success (e.g. 4/5), streak, distance accuracy (avg miss cm), tempo consistency, and change-vs-last — **no posture avatar**. A **swing** session shows the posture report below: **interactive glow joint-mannequin** — tap a joint marker and a card **grows out of that exact point**, showing a **looping close-up** of the joint through the swing, a big metric, status tag, one-line coaching, and 4 phase thumbnails (problem = red border) you can tap to review; leader lines to callouts; whole-figure phase switch + Replay · key finding · 4 posture phases · 4 swing metrics with change-vs-last · mission success & streak · one-line reflection |
| **Growth** | weekly summary · Calendar / Metrics / Before-After tabs · **tap any practiced day in the calendar to reopen that session (the popup grows out of the tapped date, matching the joint-detail card)** — the same interactive avatar view (glow figure, joint markers → grow-from-point close-up loop, phase frames, metrics) filled with that day's data. The calendar is a table of contents into past sessions; earlier days sit closer to baseline, recent days show the improvement. · metric trend vs baseline · before/after avatar comparison |
| **Profile** | handicap · goal · round schedule · device settings (camera, laser, voice) · home-position re-setup · on-device privacy · notifications |

The flow is **START → Training-in-progress screen → (practice) → Session Report** — pressing START never jumps straight to the report. The training screen is deliberately minimal (zero-screen): "Put your phone down", the current mission name + balance mode, a **live elapsed timer + set progress** (e.g. Set 4/10), a gently rotating waiting ring, and an **End session** button (plus Cancel — don't save). Ending → Session Report; Cancel → back with nothing saved.

The **center START** button opens the *zero-screen* session overlay ("put your
phone down — come back after"), which then leads to the Session Report.

## Design

- Deep warm near-black ground + a single lime/chartreuse accent (`#CDF23F`).
- Frosted-glass bento: translucent cards, `backdrop-filter` blur, 1px light
  borders, in-phone light so glass reads. One lime-filled card per screen for
  asymmetric emphasis; hero-sized numerals for key figures (D-day, success rate).
- **Everything is hand-drawn:** the glowing volumetric joint-mannequin (mint/teal
  gradient body + lime skeleton overlay + pulsing joint markers), line/spark
  charts, calendar, rings and all icons are **inline SVG** — no libraries, no
  external fonts (system `-apple-system` stack for the Apple mood).
- Metrics are **golf-posture only** — spine angle, shoulder rotation, weight
  transfer, wrist-release timing. No muscle mass, flexibility, or medical data.

## Launch-screen photo
Drop your background photo at **`assets/launch.jpg`** (portrait, ~1200px+ wide).
The source app picks it up immediately. For the single-file `standalone.html`
and the shared Artifact, re-run the build (it base64-embeds the photo so it
travels with the file); without it, a golf-toned gradient stands in.
